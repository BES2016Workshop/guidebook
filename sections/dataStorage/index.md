There are many options for data storing depending on duration, data type, and step in data processing.  Simplifying  work flows by having data deposition in central accessible locations helps maintain continuity in analysis and communication. Although there are many options for data storage at the moment, the discussion of the future our scientific data is still evolving and very much in debate.  Scientists should be conscious of how and where our data will be housed at every stage of our research. 

### Data Storage Options 

- [knb](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#data/page/0) Focuses on large ecological datasets, specific to [Ecological Meta Data Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_Metadata_Language) XML data formats. 
- [dataONE](http://www.dataone.org/) Focus on environmental science, community run.
- [Data Dyrad](http://datadryad.org/) Dyrad is non-profit data repository. Submission of data requires the payment of a fee, but an increasing number of journals are contracted with Dyrad to cover this fee.
- [figshare](http://figshare.com/?gclid=CIzqiIXiu70CFeJF7AodQU8A_w) A digital repository for scientific products such as data, figures, images, movies, and other content that accompanies how research is communicated. 
- [zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) A digital repository for the long-tail of science, enabling researchers to share and preserve any research outputs in any size, any format and from any science. 
- [re3data](http://www.re3data.org/) A global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines that helps researchers identify an appropriate data repository to store their data.
