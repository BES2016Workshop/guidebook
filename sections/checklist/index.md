Reproduciblity can occur at every step in the history of your project. How easy will it be for others or your future self to answer these questions?    

## Documentation

&#x274f; Is it clear where to begin? (e.g., can someone picking a project up see where to start running it)   
&#x274f; can you determine which file(s) was/were used as input in a process that produced a derived file?   
&#x274f; Who do I cite? (code, data, etc.)   
&#x274f; Is there documentation about every result?   
&#x274f; Have you noted the exact version of every external application used in the process?   
&#x274f; For analyses that include randomness, have you noted the underlying random seed(s)?   
&#x274f; Have you specified the license under which you're distributing your content, data, and code?   
&#x274f; Have you noted the license(s) for others peoples' content, data, and code used in your analysis?   

## Organization

&#x274f; Which is the most recent data file/code?   
&#x274f; Which folders can I safely delete?   
&#x274f; Do you keep older files/code or delete them?   
&#x274f; Can you find a file for a particular replicate of your research project?   
&#x274f; Have you stored the raw data behind each plot?   
&#x274f; Is your analysis output done hierarchically? (allowing others to find more detailed output underneath a summary)   
&#x274f; Do you run backups on all files associated with your analysis?   
&#x274f; How many times has a particular file been generated in the past?   
&#x274f; Why was the same file generated multiple times?   
&#x274f; Where did a file that I didn't generate come from?   

## Automation

&#x274f; Are there lots of manual data manipulation steps are there?   
&#x274f; Are all custom scripts under version control?   
&#x274f; Is your writing (content) under version control?   

## Publication

&#x274f; Have you archived the exact version of every external application used in your process(es)?   
&#x274f; Did you include a reproducibility statement or declaration at the end of your paper(s)?   
&#x274f; Are textual statements connected/linked to the supporting results or data?   
&#x274f; Did you archived preprints of resulting papers in a public repository?   
&#x274f; Did you release the underlying code at the time of publishing a paper?   
&#x274f; Are you providing public access to your scripts, runs, and results?
