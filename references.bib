  abstract = {We believe that replicating studies in ecology and evolution is extremely valuable, but replication within species and systems is troublingly rare, and even `quasi-replications' in different systems are often insufficient. We make a case for supporting multiple types of replications and point out that the current incentive structure needs to change if ecologists and evolutionary biologist are to value scientific replication sufficiently.},
