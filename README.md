# reproducible-guidebook

This repository is my attempt at combining the current information on reproducible research into a comprehensive database of resources in the hope of somehow creating a uniform `reproducibility theorem`.

## Draft only currently

A combination of blogs, research articles and guides for reproducible research

To DO:

- file structure (anthony - in drafts)

- definitions (From nature/science and pnas) - draft not pushed yet

- reproducibility guides
    - for genomics

- Combine .md post info into this `repo`.

- reference all reproduce guides?

- reproducibility in IT

- reproducibility in data science

Main info is in `_drafts` and `resources.md` file.

## References

It is important to refer to these resources for supporting information. Feel free to develop and "correct" these resources where appropriate.
