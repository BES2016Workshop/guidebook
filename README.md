# reproducible-guidebook

This repository is my attempt at combining the current information on reproducible research into a comprehensive database of resources in the hope of somehow creating a uniform `reproducibility theorem`.

## Draft only currently

A combination of blogs, research articles and guides for reproducible research

### To DO

- literature review
    - reproducible
    - reference all reproduce guides?
    - reproducibility in IT
    - reproducibility in data science
    - Combine .md post info into this `repo`

- file structure (anthony - in drafts)

- definitions (From nature/science and pnas) - draft not pushed yet

- workflows
    - R
    - Python

- reproducibility guides
    - for genomics

## Status

Currently the main info is in `_drafts` and `resources.md` file.

## References

It is important to refer to these resources for supporting information. Feel free to develop and "correct" these resources where appropriate.

### From Karl Broman guidebook

I have drawn on this simple guide a lot in developing this guide as it is a simple starting point along with the [BES guidelines 2018](/_assets/pdfs/BES_guide.pdf).

#### Initial steps toward reproducible research

"A minimal standard for data analysis and other scientific computations is
that they be _reproducible_: that the code and data are assembled in a
way so that another group can re-create all of the results (e.g., the
figures in a paper)." View Karl's tutorial [here](https://kbroman.org/steps2rr).

### Meta-analysis

This is used for the lit. review and extended this into a reproducible document.
