There are many many different posts on reproducible workflows. This document collects the current resources avaliable in R and RMarkdown. I have started this document from a combination of different git repositories:

- [BES guidelines](https://github.com/BES2016Workshop/guidebook)

However because of this my workflow has a distinctly ecological feel along with the tidyverse approach of [tooling](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). I apologise for this in advance. If you are not a R user I would recommend modifying this workflow or finding another workflow with the same components but in your field.

# Overview

Since the development of R and RStudio (and a magnitude of other IT changes happening at the same time) there are now tools for working with issues to do with [reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970). There are many blogs from a simple web search. 
Here is a collection of the posts I have drawn inspiration from:

- [R bloggers post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reproducible-research-and-r-workflow/): Jeromy Anglim
- [Reproducible workflows in RStudio](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/basic-git-lesson/2016/08/25/)
- [R workflow](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/09/r-workflow-fun/): Mara Averick
- [Methods in Ecology](https://methodsblog.com/2016/10/05/reproducibility-with-r/)
- [workflow general tips](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html)
- [Data Science and R/Python](https://community.rstudio.com/t/data-science-project-template-for-r/3230)
- [Truely reproducible](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2017/07/a-truly-reproducible-r-workflow/)
- [EEB313H1](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/lec16-rmarkdown.html)
- [Good enough practices for Scientific Computing] (https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/)

#### General databases

rOpenSci [is a non-profit initiative founded in 2011 by Karthik Ram, Scott Chamberlain, and Carl Boettiger to make scientific data retrieval reproducible. Over the past seven years we have developed an ecosystem of open source tools, we run annual conferences, and review community developed software.](https://ropensci.org/about/)

[The Reproducible Research CRAN Task View] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html)

They have produced a great interface for reproducible packages in R with documentation. 

##### PLOS have taken this up too:

- [Best practices for Scientific Computing] (http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)

- [10 simple rules for reproducible computational research] http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285

- [A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects] http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424

- [Ten Simple Rules for Digital Data Storage] (http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097)

#### And even leading ecological journals have also identified this as an key issue in many conservation and enviromental issues:

##### [@cassey2006]


### [@nakagawa2015] 


### [@zotero-6387]

## Coding groups

- [Uni of Toronto Coders](https://github.com/UofTCoders)
  -[R course](https://github.com/UofTCoders/rcourse)
  
- [UBC statistics course](http://stat545.com/Classroom/)

With all the resources above I have created a evolving "workflow" for my research.
