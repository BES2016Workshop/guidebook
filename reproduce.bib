The overall conclusions of a meta-analysis, however, depend heavily on the quality of the meta-analytic process, and an appropriate evaluation of the quality of metaanalysis (meta-evaluation) can be challenging. We outline ten questions biologists can ask to critically appraise a meta-analysis. These questions could also act as simple and accessible guidelines for the authors of meta-analyses. We focus on meta-analyses using nonhuman species, which we term `biological' metaanalysis. Our ten questions are aimed at enabling a biologist to evaluate whether a biological meta-analysis embodies `mega-enlightenment', a `mega-mistake', or something in between.},

  shorttitle = {Reproducible, Flexible and High Throughput Data Extraction from Primary Literature},
  abstract = {1. Research synthesis, such as meta-analysis requires the extraction of effect sizes from primary literature. Such effect sizes are calculated from summary statistics. However, exact values of such statistics are commonly hidden in figures.

2. Extracting summary statistics from figures can be a slow process that is not easily reproducible. Additionally, current software lacks an ability to incorporate important meta-data (e.g., sample sizes, treatment/variable names) about experiments and is not integrated with other software to streamline analysis pipelines.

3. Here we present the R package metaDigitise which extracts descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations and correlations from the four plot types: 1) mean/error plots (e.g. bar graphs with standard errors), 2) box plots, 3) scatter plots and 4) histograms. metaDigitise is user- friendly and easy to learn as it interactively guides the user through the data extraction process. Notably, it enables large-scale extraction by automatically loading image files, letting the user stop processing, edit and add to the resulting data frame at any point.

4. Digitised data can be easily re-plotted and checked, facilitating reproducible data extraction from plots with little inter-observer bias. We hope that by making the process of figure extraction more flexible and easy to conduct it will improve the transparency and quality of meta- analyses in the future.},

The conditions contributing to irreproducibility in other disciplines are also present in ecology. These include a large discrepancy between the proportion of ``positive'' or ``significant'' results and the average statistical power of empirical research, incomplete reporting of sampling stopping rules and results, journal policies that discourage replication studies, and a prevailing publish-or-perish research culture that encourages questionable research practices. We argue that these conditions constitute sufficient reason to systematically evaluate the reproducibility of the evidence base in ecology and evolution. In some cases, the direct replication of ecological research is difficult because of strong temporal and spatial dependencies, so here, we propose metaresearch projects that will provide proxy measures of reproducibility.},

There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount. I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two. Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64\% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42\% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51\% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

  shorttitle = {The Replication and Reproducibility Crises},
  abstract = {Watch the VIDEO.There is a widespread discussion around a scientific crisis, resulting from a lack of reproducibility of published scientific studies. This was exemplified by Ioannidis' 2005 paper ``Why most published research findings are false'' or the 2015 Open Science Collaboration study assessing reproducibility of psychological science. An often-cited reason for this reproducibility crisis is a fundamental misunderstanding of what statistical methods, and in particular P-values, can achieve. In the context of studies of ecology and evolution, I will show how 1) the pressure for publishing ``novel'' results, 2) what Gelman has called the ``garden of forking paths'', i.e. the fact that published analyses represent only one out of many possible analyses, and 3) the often fruitless dichotomy between a null and alternative hypotheses, has led to the present situation. While scientific progress is dependent of major breakthroughs, we also need to find a better balance between confirmatory research \textendash{} understanding how known effects vary in size according to the context \textendash{} and exploratory, non-incremental research \textendash{} finding new effects.},

  issn = {2325-0828},
  abstract = {The ability to reproduce ecological or climate change experiments or quantitative results is a hallmark of science, but not the only one. In addition, a scientist who subsequently examines original research must be able to reproduce the interpretation of the observations. Confidence in both ecology and climate science research is undermined when an a priori interpretation cannot be confirmed. This will happen when an a priori (before investigation) assumption was introduced by the original author(s), even inadvertently, regarding the nature of the universe or a subset of it. Such an assumption is here termed an ontological assumption when it then is treated as invariant; that is, it is not changed as unsupportive evidence, whether positive or negative, is accumulated. It thus conditions the interpretation of observed scientific phenomena. The results of the scientific investigation are therefore interpreted within the framework of this assumption, even though this framework is at variance with actual results obtained. Recent decades have seen increasing use of paleoclimatic studies as predictors of what will happen as current global climate change unfolds. Here we consider how the results from impact studies of paleoclimatic change on biotic communities have been used as a basis for neoclimatic and ecological research and prediction. We show that in some cases at least the observed results of these paleoclimatic studies were not in accord with the original interpretations, the paleoclimatic workers having held onto unwarranted ontological assumptions in the face of observations to the contrary. This practice is a threat to validity and undermines the applicability of these original paleonvironmental studies to later neoenvironmental work. For example, contrary to expectations, Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles did not always impact on community diversity, whether measured by species richness or the information function. Likewise, the quantitative assemblage turnover index (ATI) shows that in the greenhouse world of the Eocene, communities actually were little impacted by lithological changes associated with quantitatively-determined climatic perturbations. We demonstrate that the application of simple statistical measures can draw attention to unwarranted paleoecological ontological assumptions and avoid their being applied inappropriately to neoecological work.},

  abstract = {The Editorial by M. McNutt (``Journals unite for reproducibility,'' 7 November, p. [679][1], published online 5 November) describes an updated version of the solution from journals, including Science and Nature , for reproducibility in biomedical research. If the new policy is to be widely implemented by scientific journals, then the changes must be consistent and mandatory.

Reproducibility is not just relevant for biomedical research. Ecology and biodiversity scientists are also increasingly concerned about issues of reproducibility and data sharing ([ 1 ][2]\textendash{}[ 3 ][3]). Reproducibility is challenging for ecology and biodiversity science because experiments are usually undertaken under natural conditions in the field, across different spatial and temporal scales ([ 4 ][4]). For this reason, there are no prevalent recommendations for quality control and few for sharing data in these disciplines [one data-sharing option is Dryad ([ 5 ][5])]. It is time for ecologists and biodiversity scientists to work out some principles and guidelines equivalent to that in biomedical research; scientists and journals can start with a stringent data-sharing policy.

In 2000 and 2001, 92\% of sampled articles in Conservation Biology and Biological Conservation reported results of null-hypothesis tests. In 2005 this figure dropped to 78\%. There were corresponding increases in the use of confidence intervals, information theoretic, and Bayesian techniques. Of those articles reporting null-hypothesis testing--which still easily constitute the majority--very few report statistical power (8\%) and many misinterpret statistical nonsignificance as evidence for no effect (63\%).

While 248 articles included experiments that could have been influenced by observer bias, only 13.3\% of these articles indicated that experiments were blinded. The use of blind observation therefore was either grossly underreported in the surveyed articles, or many EEB studies were not blinded. We hope that a concerted effort of the field of EEB \textendash{} including researchers, peer-reviewers, and journal editors \textendash{} will help promote and institute routine, blind observation as an essential standard that should be practiced by all sciences.},

  issn = {1469-185X},
  abstract = {Recently there has been a growing concern that many published research findings do not hold up in attempts to replicate them. We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of `you can publish if you found a significant effect'. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of `you can publish if your study is rigorous'. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of `impact' almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.},

Especially, more and more enterprises would like to manage their data by the aid of the cloud servers. However, when the data outsourced in the cloud are sensitive, the challenges of security and privacy becomes urgent for wide deployment of the cloud systems. This paper proposes a secure data sharing scheme to ensure the privacy of data owner and the security of the outsourced cloud data. The proposed scheme provides flexible utility of data while solving the privacy and security challenges for data sharing. The security and efficiency analysis demonstrate that the designed scheme is feasible and efficient. At last, we discuss its application in electronic health record.},

  abstract = {Social media provides unique opportunities for data collection. Retrospective analysis of social media posts has been used in seismology, political science and public risk perception studies but has not been used extensively in ecological research. There is currently no assessment of whether such data are valid and robust in ecological contexts. We used ``Twitter mining'' methods to search Twitter (a microblogging site) for terms relevant to three nationwide UK ecological phenomena: winged ant emergence; autumnal house spider sightings; and starling murmurations. To determine the extent to which Twitter-mined data were reliable and suitable for answering specific ecological questions the data so gathered were analysed and the results directly compared to the findings of three published studies based on primary data collected by citizen scientists during the same time period. Twitter-mined data proved robust for quantifying temporal ecological patterns. There was striking similarity in the temporal patterns of winged ant emergence between previously published work and our analysis of Twitter-mined data at national scales; this was also the case for house spider sightings. Spatial data were less available but analysis of Twitter-mined data was able to replicate most spatial findings from all three studies. Baseline ecological findings, such as the sex ratio of house spider sightings, could also be replicated. Where Twitter mining was less successful was answering specific questions and testing hypotheses. Thus, we were unable to determine the influence of microhabitat on winged ants or test predation and weather hypotheses for initiation of murmuration behaviour. Twitter mining clearly has great potential to generate spatiotemporal ecological data and to answer specific ecological questions. However, we found that the types and usefulness of data differed substantially between the three phenomena. Consequently, we suggest that understanding users' behaviour when posting on ecological topics would be useful if using social media is to generate ecological data.},

Diagnoses in turn open the path to possible solutions. This discussion is urgent given the impact of the crises on public trust in institutions.

  abstract = {Objective: To review and describe randomization techniques used in clinical trials, including simple, block, stratified, and covariate adaptive techniques. Background: Clinical trials are required to establish treatment efficacy of many athletic training procedures. In the past, we have relied on evidence of questionable scientific merit to aid the determination of treatment choices. Interest in evidencebased practice is growing rapidly within the athletic training profession, placing greater emphasis on the importance of wellconducted clinical trials. One critical component of clinical trials that strengthens results is random assignment of participants to control and treatment groups. Although randomization appears to be a simple concept, issues of balancing sample sizes and controlling the influence of covariates a priori are important. Various techniques have been developed to account for these issues, including block, stratified randomization, and covariate adaptive techniques. Advantages: Athletic training researchers and scholarly clinicians can use the information presented in this article to better conduct and interpret the results of clinical trials. Implementing these techniques will increase the power and validity of findings of athletic medicine clinical trials, which will ultimately improve the quality of care provided.},

Large volumes of ecological data may be readily available through institutions or data repositories that are the most comprehensive available and can serve as the core of ecological analysis. Ecological data are also employed outside the research context and are used for decision-making, natural resource management, education, and other purposes.

  title = {Response: {{Symmetry}}, Size and Stress},
  volume = {15},
  abstract = {In their recent TREE perspective, Bjorksten
et al.1 suggested that fluctuating
asymmetry (FA) is a poor measure of
susceptibility to stress. Unfortunately, their
article is based on selective citation of the
literature, which biases their conclusions in a
particular direction. Recently, a meta-analysis
(N. Cad\'ee, PhD thesis, Universit\'e Pierre et
Marie Curie, France, 2000) of all available
studies (20 in total compared with the few
cited by Bjorksten et al.) has been made, and
responses of FA and size to environmental
stress have been estimated. The mean effect
size (Pearson correlation coefficient adjusted
for sample size2) for FA in the 20 studies was
0.16, whereas it was 0.22 for size for exactly
the same studies. Interestingly, this
conclusion was not significantly biased by the
quality of the studies included, whether the
studies were experimental or observational, or
by the year of publication. However, one
factor seriously biased the effect size for body
size: in studies with mortality effect size was
significantly larger (mean r 5 0.33) than in
studies without mortality (mean r 5 0.21).
There was no such bias for effect size of
character asymmetry. Thus, mortality can
seriously bias estimates of effect size of body
size. Interestingly, the effect size for
asymmetry was unrelated to the effect size for
FA (r 520.0001 for the 88 samples). This
indicates that size responses to stress
estimate different phenomena than FA. Thus,
size and asymmetry are not alternatives \textendash{} they
are complementary.},

  abstract = {A recent and prominent claim for the value of biodiversity is its importance for sustaining multiple ecosystem functions. The general idea is intuitively appealing: since all species are to some extent unique, each will be important for a different set of functions. Therefore, as more functions are considered, a greater diversity of species is necessary to sustain all functions simultaneously. However, we show here that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning does not change with the number of functions considered. Biodiversity affects the level of multifunctionality via non-additive effects on individual functions, and the effect on multifunctionality equals the average effect on single functions. These insights run counter to messages in the literature. In the light of our simulations, we present limitations and pitfalls with current methods used to study biodiversity\textendash{}multifunctionality, which together provide a perspective for future studies.},

  abstract = {To date, the processing of wildlife location data has relied on a diversity of software and file formats. Data management and the following spatial and statistical analyses were undertaken in multiple steps, involving many time-consuming importing/exporting phases. Recent technological advancements in tracking systems have made large, continuous, high-frequency datasets of wildlife behavioural data available, such as those derived from the global positioning system (GPS) and other animal-attached sensor devices. These data can be further complemented by a wide range of other information about the animals' environment. Management of these large and diverse datasets for modelling animal behaviour and ecology can prove challenging, slowing down analysis and increasing the probability of mistakes in data handling. We address these issues by critically evaluating the requirements for good management of GPS data for wildlife biology. We highlight that dedicated data management tools and expertise are needed. We explore current research in wildlife data management. We suggest a general direction of development, based on a modular software architecture with a spatial database at its core, where interoperability, data model design and integration with remote-sensing data sources play an important role in successful GPS data handling.},
